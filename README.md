# Code Challenge

## Problem 1: Three ways to sum to n

Provide 3 unique implementations of the following function in JavaScript.
**Input**: `n` - any integer
*Assuming this input will always produce a result lesser than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`*.
**Output**: `return` - summation to `n`, i.e. `sum_to_n(5) === 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 === 15`.

## Problem 2: Fancy Form
Create a currency swap form based on the template provided in the folder. A user would use this form to swap assets from one currency to another.

*You may use any third party plugin, library, and/or framework for this problem.*

1. You may add input validation/error messages to make the form interactive.
2. Your submission will be rated on its usage intuitiveness and visual attractiveness.
3. Show us your frontend development and design skills, feel free to totally disregard the provided files for this problem.
4. You may use this [repo](https://github.com/Switcheo/token-icons/tree/main/tokens) for token images, e.g. [SVG image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Switcheo/token-icons/main/tokens/SWTH.svg).
5. You may use this [URL](https://interview.switcheo.com/prices.json) for token price information and to compute exchange rates (not every token has a price, those that do not can be omitted).

## Problem 3: Messy React
List out the computational inefficiencies and anti-patterns found in the code block below.

1. This code block uses
    - 1. ReactJS with TypeScript.
    - 2. Functional components.
    - 3. React Hooks
2. You should also provide a refactored version of the code, but more points are awarded to accurately stating the issues and explaining correctly how to improve them.
